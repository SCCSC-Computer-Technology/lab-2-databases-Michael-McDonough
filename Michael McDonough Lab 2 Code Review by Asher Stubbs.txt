Michael McDonough Lab 2 Code Review
By Asher Stubbs
Overall I felt this lab was executed very well by Michael, the code is clear and concise with comments on any questionable or possibly confusing lines. I particularly like his solution to adding, editing, and deleting records; it feels refined and professional. His code differed from mine pretty significantly, but mostly just because of sophistication and attention to detail. The only thing I personally feel is missing is that the highest and lowest population stats are displayed as just the raw population numbers and the city/record ID is not given. This is only a slight shortcoming in my opinion as if the dataset were much larger, finding the specific city tied to the highest/lowest population may prove tedious. He included try/catches where they were needed for parsing or updating so crashes should be unlikely. I did not find any run errors or coding errors in my use of it. Using SQL queries for the button functions is something I also did, I believe it simplifies things and tidies up the code.
